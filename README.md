Code For My FdSc Web Based Database Module

This web site is being built as part of my 2nd year FdSc in Computing.  All the code has to be my own, and it has to prove that I can create a web site with an attached database.  The web site is to access the database and show at least one of each of the following queries:

SELECT
INSERT
UPDATE
DELETE

Obviously the more functionality I can put in to the web site, the better the mark I could possibly get.

I have decided to put this code on GitHub as I am using multiple devices, my desktop while I am home, and my laptop while I am at Uni.  By putting this on GitHub I am making sure I never lose any of the code at this important time.

If anyone does happen to look at this code, please can they comment only.  Obviously like any development process, especially for a novice like myself, getting feedback is an essential part of the process, this can even be being shown how to do something, but finally the code is to be mine and mine alone as this is what I will be graded on.

Thanks in advance

Darren
